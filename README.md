# SpotifyExtendedHistoryStats
This is a piece of software currently under development to display a GUI of statistics of your Spotify listening history from the Extended Listening History that you can download from Spotify.

It is currently planned to first write this in PHP and make other versions of it down the line in other languages such as JavaScript or C.
